## Overview

This project displays a user profile card component that includes:
- A user avatar  
- Name and short bio  
- Hobbies and dislikes  
- Social media links (X/Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok)  
- A dynamically displayed timestamp (in milliseconds)  

It’s designed with a **mobile-first approach** to ensure smooth performance and clean layout on all screen sizes.

### Task instructions
 In this task, you’ll build a small, accessible, responsive Profile Card component/page using semantic HTML and modern frontend patterns using plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS. Every visible element must include a data-testid attribute so automated tests can target it.


Acceptance criteria (checklist for grading / automated tests)
 All required elements exist and are discoverable by the given data-testids.
 HTML uses semantic tags (article, figure, nav, section, headings).
 The test-user-time value equals Date.now() (or a value within a reasonable delta if rendering delay exists) and is shown in milliseconds.
 Avatar renders with an alt attribute and data-testid="test-user-avatar".
 Social links present inside test-user-social-links and optionally individually testable (e.g., test-user-social-twitter).
 Hobbies and dislikes are distinct lists with their respective data-testids.
 Keyboard navigation works for links; focus styles are visible.
 Layout is responsive at typical breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop).
